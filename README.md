Twitter Search App

Build an app which uses Twitter API.
This app must know how to:

- login the user through API;
- search tweets by hashtag;
- display search results.

Final application must be represented as Single Page Application (SPA).  The user interface should be clear, simple and well understandable.

Great pluses would be:

- ReactJS;
- Any kind of build system;
- ES6.
- WEB Component approach.

The final result must be pushed to any GitHub and contain instructions with deployment process. Also, test link must be provided.
